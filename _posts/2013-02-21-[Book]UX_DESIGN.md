### Overview

Research -> Insight -> UX vision -> Concept -> Design

at the start of our project, we began by trying to understand the design problem from the business's perspective. Then we went into the world we could validate our thinking and gain empathy for the eventual users of our project.

Once armed with this knowledge, the ux process looked at sketching ideas and brainstorming with others as a way to explore design patterns and possible directions we could take. following this, we created interactive prototypes of our design, in order to visualize a model of our thinking.

all the way along, we involved users as we tweaked, refined, and updated our design.

at last, we launch our product, which is far from the end, we need dig into the operation data to review our design, find new problems, then iterate once again...
